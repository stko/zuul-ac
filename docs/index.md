# Not another App needed

Your friends do not need again another App or another user account. If they are one of the todays 400 million Telegram users, you can instandly lend your door key to them.

# Made for Hierarchical Groups too
Zuul-AC was made to manage also hierarchical groups: Imagine, you are the manager of a sports club and the owner of the Sports Home keys. With Zuul-AC you can lend your key to all your team leaders, and they can lend the key to all their team members.

If you then return your key from one of your team leaders, all the keys he has lend further disappear instandly - no more uncontrolled keys all over the place

# Smart Home Integration
Zuul-AC is no standalone program, it's been made as an Add-On to work with many of todays Smart Home solutions

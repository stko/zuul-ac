## Not another App needed

Your friends do not need again another App or another user account. If they are one of the todays 400 million Telegram users, you can instandly lend your door key to them.

## Made for Hierarchical Groups too
Zuul was made to manage also hierarchical groups: Imagine, you are the manager of a sports club and the owner of the Sports Home keys. With Zuul you can lend your key to all your team leaders, and they can lend the key to all their team members.

If you then return your key from one of your team leaders, all the keys he has lend further disappear instandly - no more uncontrolled keys all over the place

## Smart Home Integration
Zuul is no standalone program, it's been made to work with many of todays Smart Home solutions

## More Information?
All further Details are in the [Zuul Wiki](https://github.com/stko/zuul-ac/wiki/en_start)


## Status of this Software
The status of this software is 'it works for me' - which means not everything, which is possible, is already finally implemented.

This is just because I personally do not need more as that what is working today, so I didn't want to put more efforts as long there are not more users really using it


## Commercial use?
Yes, please - the idea of zuul is to have a common principle for as many doors as possible, so if you want to make your product better by offering zuul for your customers too, please feel free to do so
